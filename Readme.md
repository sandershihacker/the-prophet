# The Prophet
## A Build-18 Project

### Introduction
We will use the Particle prototype, and sensors that collect data relevant to
weather analysing to build a module that can collect weather data, without ever
running out of charge for years. Once data is collected, it will be sent to a
server to be analysed. Multiple modules would be used in an area as a sensory
array to provide more accurate and local on the spot weather data to meteorology
centers worldwide. With enough sensors, a machine learning algorithm can be used
to help predict weather in a certain area.
